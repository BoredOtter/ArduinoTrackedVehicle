# # ArduinoTrackedRC

Simple remote control tracked vehicle based on Arduino UNO for controlling hardware on chassis and Arduino Nano as the remote controll. It uses radio communication via nrf24l01 module.

# Hardware

 - **Arduino UNO ->** controlls DC Motors on chassis and recive signal from remote controll
 - **Arduino NANO->** works as a remote controll
 - **DC Motor controller ->** L298N by DFRobot  
 - **Chassis ->** Devastator by DFRobot
 - **Motors->** Metal DC Geared Motor - 6V (here works at about 8V) 

## ToDo:

 - **Radio timeout check**
 - **Add some sensors and display**
 - **Think about application other than driving it for fun**
